# We will first create a simple Dockerfile where we have app.py

FROM ubuntu:latest

WORKDIR /app

COPY . /app

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["python", "app.py"]



FROM command is used as we have to get a base image for our docker container. Our docker container has a base image in additon to host O.S. We are getting the image from dockerhub

    We can use any image, for eg, debian, alpine etc


WORKDIR - We are specifying the working dir in our docker container where we will keep all the application files from local. If we dont give a workdir, then in next step we can specify COPY . . 

COPY . /app --> we will copy all the files in our current dir to /app inside the container.

RUN - then using run command, 


CMD - First thing that we want to execute inside our docker container. 

# Building first docker image

To create the image, i run - `docker build -t adminnik/my-first-image:v1 .`

The . at last is very imortant as when we pass docker build command to docker cli, docker daemon starts to execute the docker file. so it needs the path where Dockerfile is present.

docker daemon receives the instruction from dockerfile, and executes all the commands one by one
# O/P

docker images
REPOSITORY                    TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
adminnik/first-image          v1        0f1954a1437a   4 minutes ago   568MB

Its necessary to provide a tag, otherwise the image will be produced with a random docker image commit id.

# Running the image

`docker run -it adminnik/my-first-image:v1` 

When we run the above command, our application will be begin to run on the machine, and we coudl view it on the public ip of that ec2


# push image to docker hub registry

`docker push adminnik/first-image:v1`

1. docker volume ls -- Provides us with the list of running volumes

```
docker volume ls

DRIVER    VOLUME NAME
local     minikube

```

2. docker volume create amit -- Creates a new volume with logical partition on host which we cannot see

```
docker volume create amit 
amit

docker volume ls          
DRIVER    VOLUME NAME
local     amit
local     minikube

```

We can dedicate this specific volume to one or many containers.

3. To understand a volume, when it was created, where is it created (local or external file system), we can inspect using 

- docker volume inspect amit

```
docker volume inspect amit
[
    {
        "CreatedAt": "2024-09-23T06:38:03Z",
        "Driver": "local",
        "Labels": null,
        "Mountpoint": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/amit/_data",
        "Name": "amit",
        "Options": null,
        "Scope": "local"
    }
]

```

4. docker volume rm amit - Delete a volume
   docker volume rm <name1> <name2> <name3> - Delete multiple volumes

```
docker volume rm amit
amit

docker volume ls
DRIVER    VOLUME NAME
local     minikube

```

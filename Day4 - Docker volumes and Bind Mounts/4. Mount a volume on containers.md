We will mount a volume that we create on our local host onto our container.

1. Create a volume - docker volume create amit
2. Mount the volume - docker run -d --mount source=amit, target=/app nginx:latest

        -d signifies container running in detached mode 
        --mount gives us more verbosity 
        source - is the name of volume 
        target - on the container 
        nginx:latest - Image name 

So this container will be running with a mount.  Since we dont have the image locally, it will first download the image, spin up the container, and attach the volume amit to it.

```
docker run -d --mount source=amit,target=/app nginx:latest 
Unable to find image 'nginx:latest' locally

```

3. docker ps - Gives us the list of running containers 

```
docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                    COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                    NAMES
beb9623622e8   nginx:latest             "/docker-entrypoint.…"   42 seconds ago   Up 41 seconds   80/tcp                   nostalgic_fermat
49e461e49df6   adminnik/go-web-app:v2   "./main"                 6 weeks ago      Up 11 days      0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp   romantic_sammet
terminal~ % 

```

4. docker inspect <container-id> --> docker inspect beb9623622e8 

The above command gives us the entire detail of our container. Ip address, wheteher the container has a mount or not, mode of mount like RW or Read only.

```
"Mounts": [
            {
                "Type": "volume",
                "Name": "amit",
                "Source": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/amit/_data",
                "Destination": "/app",
                "Driver": "local",
                "Mode": "z",
                "RW": true,
                "Propagation": ""
            }
        ],

```

we can see the mount, the mount source on local host and on container, the mount is hosted on /app dir. We did not create - /var/lib/docker/volumes/amit/_data, unlike bind mounts, docker in case of volume, itself creates a logical volume for us on local host/external host.


5. To stop a volume, we first need to stop the container 

6. We cannot directly delete a volume if its in use. If we directly delete the volume. fails with below error

```
docker volume rm amit
Error response from daemon: remove amit: volume is in use - [beb9623622e88dfc1a4ae147b8a77c22e30e6d96e96744bdf34268e347047956]

```

So firstly we have to stop the container, delete it, and then only we can delte the volume associated.

stop your container – docker stop <container_name>
remove a container – docker rm <container name>

```
docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                    COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                    NAMES
beb9623622e8   nginx:latest             "/docker-entrypoint.…"   12 minutes ago   Up 12 minutes   80/tcp                   nostalgic_fermat
49e461e49df6   adminnik/go-web-app:v2   "./main"                 6 weeks ago      Up 11 days      0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp   romantic_sammet

terminal~ % docker stop beb9623622e8
beb9623622e8

terminal~ % docker ps - We can see the contianer is no longer running

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                    COMMAND    CREATED       STATUS       PORTS                    NAMES
49e461e49df6   adminnik/go-web-app:v2   "./main"   6 weeks ago   Up 11 days   0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp   romantic_sammet

terminal~ % docker ps -a - We can see it in stopped containers list

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                 COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                     PORTS                    NAMES
beb9623622e8   nginx:latest                          "/docker-entrypoint.…"   14 minutes ago   Exited (0) 9 seconds ago                            nostalgic_fermat

```

Even after stopping the container, if we try to remove the volume, it still gives error 

```
docker volume rm amit   
Error response from daemon: remove amit: volume is in use - [beb9623622e88dfc1a4ae147b8a77c22e30e6d96e96744bdf34268e347047956]

```

so we have to first **delete the container**, only then we can detach the volume

docker rm beb9623622e8
beb9623622e8

terminal~ % docker volume rm amit 
amit
terminal~ % 

## Summary

We have nginx contianer running, to which we have attached a volume. If the nginx container goes down, the data of the contianer in /app dir is already stored in volume amit, so it can be backed up, stored and shared with others.

# What are the problems if a container goes down?

## EG 1

Suppose we have installed an nginx application inside a container. nginx tries to store all the user information that authenticated with the application in a log file. So the logfile contains imp data.

- Now suppose the container has gone down, the log files gets deleted. This is because continaers are **ephemeral**(short live) in nature since they are lightweingt in nature. They use resources like CPU, memory, storage from host O.S.

- So if a container goes down, all the resources are freed. This means the log file will also get delted.

## EG 2


Suppose we have 2 containers - Frontend and backend. The backend container keeps on writing a json file, which is read by frontend container to display content.

Now suppose the backend container has gone down. Since we did not have any persistent storage, the frontend is not able to read the records from json file


## EG 3

There is a file on the host file system that app inside the containers wants to read and display to user. How do we do that? Since container cannot access the host file system, how does one achieves this?


### Solutions

To solve these problems, docker came up with 2 concepts

1. Bind Mounts
2. Volumes




### Understanding Bind Mounts

1. **Bind Mounts**:
   - Bind mounts allow you to link a directory from the host machine to a directory in the container. 
   - The direction is typically from the **host to the container** (e.g., `/app` on the host to `/app` in the container), allowing the container to access files stored on the host.

2. **Access**:
   - If a file exists in the `/app` folder on the host, it can be read by the container. The container can also write to this folder, and those changes will be reflected on the host.

3. **Persistence**:
   - If a container (like `c1`) goes down and is removed, the data in the `/app` directory on the host remains intact. 
   - When a new container (like `c2`) is created and bound to the same `/app` directory, it will have access to the same data.

### Flow Diagram

Here’s a simplified flow diagram to illustrate the relationship:

```
Host Machine                     Container
+---------------------+           +------------------+
|                     |           |                  |
|    /app (Host)     | --------> | /app (Container) |
|                     |           |                  |
+---------------------+           +------------------+

1. Data exists in /app on Host
2. Data is accessible in /app on Container

When Container is removed:
+---------------------+
|                     |
|    /app (Host)     |  <--- Data remains intact
|                     |
+---------------------+

When new Container (c2) is created:
+---------------------+           +------------------+
|                     |           |                  |
|    /app (Host)     | --------> | /app (c2)       |
|                     |           |                  |
+---------------------+           +------------------+
```

### Summary
- Bind mounts primarily link a host directory to a container directory.
- Data is persistent on the host even if the container stops or is removed.
- You can easily create a new container that accesses the same data from the host.

Feel free to ask if you have more questions or need further clarification!


### Understanding of Volumes


1. **Lifecycle Management**:
   - Volumes offer a better lifecycle management compared to bind mounts. They are managed by Docker and can easily be created, removed, and shared between containers.

2. **Creation and Removal**:
   - You create volumes using Docker commands, and they are not tied to a specific directory on the host. Instead, Docker manages the volume storage location.

3. **Logical Partition**:
   - Volumes can be thought of as logical partitions, but they are more abstract than bind mounts since you don’t specify a host directory. Docker handles where the volume data is stored.

4. **Flexibility**:
   - Volumes can be shared among multiple containers easily, and they can be backed up or moved. You can also use external storage solutions (like NFS, cloud storage) without being restricted to the host's filesystem.

5. **Management via CLI**:
   - You can manage volumes using Docker CLI commands (like `docker volume create`, `docker volume ls`, etc.), allowing for easier lifecycle management compared to bind mounts.

### Flow Diagram

Here’s a flow diagram to illustrate how volumes work:

```
Host Machine                Docker Volume
+---------------------+     +------------------+
|                     |     |                  |
|    Volume Storage   | <--> |   Volume (v1)    |
|  (Managed by Docker)|     |                  |
+---------------------+     +------------------+
        |                          |
        |                          |
        |                          |
Container c1                  Container c2
+------------------+         +------------------+
|                  |         |                  |
|    /data (v1)    | <-----> |    /data (v1)    |
|                  |         |                  |
+------------------+         +------------------+

1. Create a volume: `docker volume create v1`
2. Attach volume to container: `docker run -v v1:/data c1`
3. Same volume can be attached to another container: `docker run -v v1:/data c2`

When you remove container c1:
- Volume v1 remains intact and can still be used by other containers.

### Summary

- **Volumes** are Docker-managed storage that provide a flexible and robust way to handle persistent data.
- They allow for easier lifecycle management, sharing, and backup options.
- You can create volumes without specifying a host directory, giving you flexibility in storage management.

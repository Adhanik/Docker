## Scneario 2

We want complete isolation btw C1 and C2. 


Container networking helps us with taking care of both the scenarios. As we have seen from previous eg, by default container can talk to host as they are making use of same veth to communicate to Host OS.

But when our C2 container has secure information, that we dont want to share, we have to implement logical network isolation.

# How to ahcieve logical network isolation ?

We will achieve this using bridge networking only. Docker allows us to create our **Custom Bridge Network**

By default, a container talks to host eth0 using veth0 which are connected by docker0 network. Instead of us using same path, we can split our network.

So initially C1 & C2 were making use of same docker0 to talk to eth0 of host machine. But we can break this network for C2 by implementing **Custom Bridge Network**. So c1 will directly talk to host using docker0, while C2 will talk to host using CBN that we will create.

This is how we achieve logical isolation in docker using bridge networking itself.


# Explaination

- **Host network:** Your host has a physical network interface, `eth0`, connected to the external network.
- **Bridge networking in Docker:** 
   - Containers like `container1` (login) and `container2` (logout) will use Docker's default bridge network (`docker0`), where each container is connected to this bridge via virtual Ethernet interfaces (`veth` pairs).
   - The bridge network allows containers to communicate with each other and the host system using internal IP addresses.

### Custom Bridge Networking for Container 3 (Payment):
To isolate `container3` (payment) for security purposes, you need to create a custom bridge network. This ensures that `container3` does not communicate with `container1` and `container2` via the default `docker0` bridge. Here’s how you can do it:

#### Steps to Create Custom Bridge Network:

1. **Create a custom bridge network**:
   ```bash
   docker network create --driver bridge secure_bridge
   ```

   This creates a new bridge called `secure_bridge` that can be used to isolate `container3`.

2. **Run `container3` on the custom bridge**:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name payment --network secure_bridge your-payment-app-image
   ```

   This ensures that `container3` is connected to `secure_bridge`, which is a different network from the default `docker0`.

3. **Run `container1` and `container2` on the default bridge**:
   - For `container1`:
     ```bash
     docker run -d --name login your-login-app-image
     ```
   - For `container2`:
     ```bash
     docker run -d --name logout your-logout-app-image
     ```

   By not specifying a network, these containers will default to the `docker0` bridge.

#### Networking Flow:
- **Containers 1 & 2:** These will connect to the default bridge `docker0` and communicate over `veth` interfaces to the host network.
- **Container 3:** This will connect to the `secure_bridge` and be isolated from `docker0`, ensuring it cannot interact with containers on the default network.

### Networking Diagram:
Here’s a simple arrow flow diagram:

```
                 Host (eth0)
                     |
      ---------------------------------
      |                               |
  docker0 (bridge)               secure_bridge (bridge)
  veth1 <-> container1 (login)   veth3 <-> container3 (payment)
  veth2 <-> container2 (logout)
```

- `veth1`, `veth2`: Connect `container1` and `container2` to `docker0`.
- `veth3`: Connects `container3` to `secure_bridge`.
- `docker0`: Default bridge where `container1` and `container2` communicate.
- `secure_bridge`: Isolated bridge for `container3`.

### Creating a Custom Bridge Network in Docker:
By creating a separate bridge network (`secure_bridge`), you're segregating `container3` from the other containers. This setup ensures that sensitive data handled by `container3` stays isolated from the rest of the containers.

### Summary

We have a Host network with eth0
We create a container 1(login),2(logout)&3(payment) which wil have its own eth0
For container 1 &2 we dont need to change anything in bridge networking, and we can start these container nomarlly using docker run command. Both of them will connects to the `docker0` bridge, using veth0, and connect to host

Container 3 has to be secure, so for this we will create custom bridge network, using docker network command.

### `ENV PIP_BREAK_SYSTEM_PACKAGES 1`

The `PIP_BREAK_SYSTEM_PACKAGES` environment variable is a setting that tells `pip` to allow the installation of packages that might overwrite or conflict with system packages. By default, `pip` tries to avoid interfering with the system Python environment, which can lead to issues when installing certain packages. By setting this variable, you're allowing `pip` to proceed even if there are potential conflicts, which can resolve installation issues but might lead to system stability concerns.

### Debugging Docker Builds

When a Docker build fails, here are some strategies to help you debug the issue:

1. **Check Build Output**: The first step is always to closely examine the output in the terminal. Look for error messages that provide clues about what went wrong.

2. **Add Debugging Commands**: You can insert commands to check the state of the file system or the contents of files at various points in your Dockerfile. For example:
   - List files: `RUN ls -la /app`
   - Print the contents of a file: `RUN cat /app/requirements.txt`
   - Show installed packages: `RUN pip list`
   - Check Python version: `RUN python3 --version`

3. **Run Interactive Builds**: You can run a build interactively to troubleshoot:
   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm ubuntu:latest /bin/bash
   ```
   From there, you can manually execute the commands in your Dockerfile to see where they fail.

4. **Use Build Stages**: If you're using Docker's multi-stage builds, you can isolate different parts of the build process, which can simplify debugging.

5. **Remove Layers**: When troubleshooting, you can use `--no-cache` to avoid cached layers that may mask issues.

6. **Use a Shell Entry Point**: Temporarily replace your `ENTRYPOINT` with a shell command to start a shell instead of your application:
   ```dockerfile
   ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/bash"]
   ```
   Then, run the container to investigate the environment.

7. **Verbose Logging**: Add verbosity to your commands, e.g., for `pip` you can use:
   ```dockerfile
   RUN pip install -vvv -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This will provide detailed logs during the installation process.

8. **Check Python and Pip Versions**: Sometimes, the Python or `pip` versions may not support certain packages. Check versions using:
   ```dockerfile
   RUN python3 --version && pip3 --version
   ```

9. **Validate `requirements.txt`**: Ensure that the packages listed in `requirements.txt` are correct and available. Sometimes typos or outdated package names can lead to failures.

### Example Debugging Dockerfile

Hereâ€™s an example of how you might incorporate some of these techniques:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt /app
COPY devops /app

# Debugging output
RUN echo "Contents of requirements.txt:" && cat /app/requirements.txt && \
    echo "Python version:" && python3 --version && \
    echo "Pip version:" && pip3 --version

ENV PIP_BREAK_SYSTEM_PACKAGES 1
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip && \
    pip install -vvv -r requirements.txt

# Finalize
WORKDIR /app/devops
ENTRYPOINT ["python3"]
CMD ["manage.py", "runserver", "0.0.0.0:8000"]
```

With these strategies, you should be able to effectively debug your Docker builds and pinpoint issues more easily.

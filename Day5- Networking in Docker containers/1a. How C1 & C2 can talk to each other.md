## Scenario 1

Suppose we have 2 conatiners, c1(frontend) & c2(backend) wants to talk to each other. There has to be a networking way of how Container c1 can talk to container c2. 

Unlike VMs, where each app has its own OS, so they are completely isolated, containers are lightweight and dont have complete OS

# Solution

we have a host with eth0, inside host we have 2 containers with their eth0, one container being the login, and other payment. they are connected by docker0, and use veth to talk to host. user can access the container from host through this virtual ethernet.

When we are using default networking, there is only one docker0, so payment app inside container c2 will also use same virtual ethernet to communicate with host. this OOB nature is not secure though. If its frontend and backend then its ok, but if it holds confidentail information , then its not good to have inter container communication.

|         |                |

### Explanation of the Diagram:

1. **Host (EC2/VM):**
   - The host machine has an `eth0` interface (e.g., `192.16.13.39`) which connects it to the broader network.

2. **Docker Bridge (`docker0`):**
   - The `docker0` bridge allows communication between the containers and the host. Both containers use this bridge to send and receive traffic.

3. **Containers:**
   - **Container C1 (Login):**
     - Has its own `eth0` interface (e.g., `172.17.0.21`).
   - **Container C2 (Payment):**
     - Also has its own `eth0` interface (e.g., `172.17.0.22`).

4. **Veth Pairs:**
   - Each container has a virtual Ethernet pair (veth) connecting it to the `docker0` bridge. This allows for communication between the container and the host.

5. **Isolation Concern:**
   - Since both containers are on the same Docker bridge, they can technically communicate with each other through the bridge. This is the concern you raised about security and isolation.
   - To ensure complete isolation, you could use custom networks or other networking options (like `overlay` or `macvlan`) to prevent C1 and C2 from seeing each other.

### Summary
- The diagram illustrates how the host, `docker0`, and the containers are interconnected.
- While both containers can communicate with the host via the `docker0` bridge, they are not fully isolated from each other in the default networking setup.
